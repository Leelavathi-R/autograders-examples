For this lab, you should write a Python program, called "isEven.py"

Given an integer x, you should return True if x is even and False otherwise.

You may assume that the number will always be an integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: x = 72
Output: True
Explanation: 72 is even

**Example 2:**

Input: x = -13
Output: False
Explanation: -13 is odd
