For this lab, you should write a Python program, called "twosum.py".

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, your program should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input has at least one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order. Your solution should be in O(n) time for full credit.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

```
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]
Output: Because nums[1] + nums[2] == 6, we return [1, 2].
```
