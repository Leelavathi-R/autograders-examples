# Valid Parenthesis Lab

Sample lab for solving the valid parenthesis problem using C. 

This autograder uses a Python driver to grade C code. It can be easily adapted to use C reference code instead of Python.

### Assessment Language
C

### Autograder Language
Python 3

### Autograding Environment 
A Dockerfile is included for ease of installation. 

### Handin Format
The autograder expects a file named `validparen.c`.

A sample solution can be found in `solution.c`.

### autograder.tar Directory Content
- **driver.py**: Python autograder
- **Makefile**: Compiles user-submitted `validparen.c` to `validparen.so`
