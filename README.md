This is a repo for example autograders. They are more complicated than hello lab in the documentation but simpler than real life scenario ones. They serve to offer instructors a better starting point with autograder writing in a variety of languages. For a detailed walkthrough of how autograders work, see [documentation](https://docs.autolabproject.com/lab/#writing-autograders).

---

For those who are interested in example autograders: We encourage you to download the folder of the autograder that you are interested in and run make to get a sense of how the autograder works and examine the content of autograder.tar.

---

For devs: Upload your autograder as a folder in this repository and copy the template below to README.md in your folder to document your autograder. Name your folder with the following format: Assessment Language-Functionality or lab name, e.g. Golang-sortlab
Your folder should contain autograde.tar, autograde-Makefile, a reference student submission file, an uncompressed autograde.tar directory, and NOTHING ELSE.
Thoroughly comment your autograde-Makefile.
