For this lab, you will be the finding the maximum sum of a subarray, given an integer array. 
A subarray is defined as a non-empty, contiguous subsequence within an array. 

Note that the given array may contain negative numbers. 

**Example 1:**

Input: x = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

**Example 2:**

Input: x = [-1, -2, -3]
Output: -1
Explanation: Each subarray must have at least one element, so the subarray [-1] has the largest sum. 

**Example 3:**

Input: x = [5, 4, -1, 7, 8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5, 4, -1, 7, 8] has the largest sum.
