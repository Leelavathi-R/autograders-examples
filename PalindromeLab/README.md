<h1>Python Autograder Template with Twosum Demo</h1>

<h2>Assessment Language</h2>
Python

<h2>Autograder Language</h2>
Python

<h2>Autograding Environment Packages</h2>
Python3 and pip are needed for the autograding environment.

<h2>Assessment Scenario</h2>
In this lab, students are required to implement a function palindrome() which takes in an integer as input. The function checks whether or not the integer is a palindrome (the number is the same whether it is read backwards or forwards).

The autograder also checks whether the function written by the student is time efficient.

<h2>Handin Format</h2>
palindrome.py
