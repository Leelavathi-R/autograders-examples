For this lab, you should write a Python program, called "palindrome.py"

Given an integer x, you should return true if x is a palindrome and false otherwise.

You may assume that the number will always be an integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: x = 242
Output: true
Explanation: 242 reads as 242 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

Input: x = -141
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads as -141. From right to left, it reads as 141-. Hence, it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads 10. From right to left, it reads 01. Hence, it is not a palindrome.
