# Input Output Autograder Template with Fiblab Demo

### Assessment Language
Golang

### Autograder Language
Shell

### Autograding Environment Packages
Golang is required for this autograder. Consult their [official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Assessment Scenario
A common scenario that instructors find themselves in is that they want to compare student output with expected output and assign points accordingly. This autograder template offers a very simple template with strong assumptions for input output comparison. It is up to the instructorsâ€™ discretion to decide the language of their assignment and the necessary supplementary files to compile a submission.

This autograder also offers a concrete demo of the template with a simple Golang assessment fiblab, where students implement a method in Golang that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Students' handin is compiled with main.go which invokes student implementation and output a single line result. The autograder feeds predefined test input into this compiled executable program, writes student output, and compares student output with expected output.

Makefile.template is a template for autograde-Makefile with pseudocode that executes the autograding job. Build your own Makefile and autograde.tar by replacing the supplementary files and the pseudocode in the relevant template files!

### Handin Format
fib.go

### autograder.tar Directory Content
```
# make routine that compiles fib.go into a program
Makefile

# test input to student program; test case per line
test_input

# expected output from student program; test case per line
test_output

# feed test_input to student program and writes output to student_output;
# test case per line
# this script assumes that the compiled program from student's handin file
# reads test case input one at a time
feed_and_log.sh

# compare student_output and test_output line by line and echo the actual
# autograding result
compare_and_grade.sh

# dependency files needed to compile fib.go
# depending on the specific needs, instructors should replace these two files
# with their own supplementary files
main.go
go.mod

# autograder template files with pseudocode;
# this offers a simple starting point for those who want to write
# their own input output autograder
# replace the feed_and_log.sh and Makefile with your own
Makefile.template
feed_and_log.sh.template
```
